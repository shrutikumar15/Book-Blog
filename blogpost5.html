                <h3>Mortal Heart</h3>


                <p>Where do I even begin? I didn’t care much for Annith in the first two books and I was nervous that I
                    wouldn’t love Mortal Heart as much as Grave Mercy or Dark Triumph because of that. I could not have
                    been more wrong.</p>

                <p>Annith is just as awesome as Ismae or Sybella, just in very different ways. I think that’s one of the
                    reasons these books are so awesome. Each character brings something new to the table. Annith is a
                    little too obedient at first but it’s quickly clear that she has a mind of her own and she’s going
                    to follow her own instincts. She’s smart and feisty and I did not see that coming. She’s very
                    guarded and she expects very little from people. That’s why Balthazaar takes her by surprise. He
                    wants to protect her and she can’t figure out why. All she knows is that she is drawn to him from
                    the first moment they meet. And let me tell you, I can’t blame the girl. Balthazaar is my favorite
                    of the three male love interests in this trilogy. Beast and Duval are awesome but they can’t hold a
                    candle to Balthazaar. Once you read Mortal Heart, you’ll know what I mean.

                </p>

                <p>The story is a lot faster paced than the first two books or maybe it was just that I loved the
                    characters so much that I couldn’t stop reading. There was still a lot of politics in the book but
                    not quite as much as the first two books. The politics are extremely interesting though. I’ve never
                    been a fan of them but this series is just so well done that I find every little thing about it
                    fascinating.

                </p>

                <p>Also, the cameos were beyond perfect and I loved seeing Beast, Sybella, Ismae, and Duval again. I
                    didn’t remember everything from the first two books when I first started Mortal Heart but things
                    quickly came back to me as I read. It also helped that the stories are all overlapping. Some of the
                    things that happened in the first two books haven’t actually happened yet and so it’s refreshing to
                    be able to read about them again.

                </p>

                <p>Overall, it’s hard for me to put into words my love for this series. It’s not often I read a trilogy
                    and love every book but that was the case with this one. I can’t recommend this series enough and if
                    you’ve already read the first two, rush out and get this one as soon as possible. </p>

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
