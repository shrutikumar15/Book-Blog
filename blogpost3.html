                <h3>Circe</h3>
                <blockquote> <i>“Witches are not so delicate,” I said. </i> </blockquote>

                <p>I absolutely loved this. If you enjoy Greek mythology, complex heroines, and a generous serving of
                    adventure, bloodshed, betrayal, magic, and monsters - both literal and figurative - then hell, READ
                    THIS BOOK.</p>

                <p>To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of Miller's The Song of Achilles when I read it a few years back.
                    I'm not sure if that's because my tastes were different back then, or if it was just because the
                    plot had more of a romantic focus than Circe. But, whatever the reason, I had no such problem with
                    this book. I was absolutely captivated from start to finish.
                </p>

                <p>Circe is part beautifully-written literary fantasy and part divine Greek soap opera. This strange
                    combination makes for a book that is extremely quotable, rich in description and detail, and also a
                    pageturner. It moves seamlessly between the broader scope of the world and its many gods and
                    monsters, to the more narrow focus of the nymph-turned-witch, Circe, and her daily life before and
                    after she is exiled to the island Aeaea.</p>

                <p>Circe becomes a powerful witch, but the strength of her story is in all her relatable flaws and
                    weaknesses. We follow her as a naive lesser nymph, longing to be accepted and loved. We stay with
                    her as she believes the lies of others and, later, becomes hardened against such deceivers. Her
                    compassion constantly battles with her rage. Understandably.
                </p>

                <p>There is some grim satisfaction to be gained as this woman who has been bullied, belittled and trod
                    on her entire life slowly claws out some vengeance for herself. The pain she endures along the way
                    means that her successes are bittersweet. In the end, Circe might be full of fantasy, backstabbing
                    and murder, but it is first and foremost the story of one woman's life - through pain, love, desire,
                    heartache and motherhood.</p>

                <blockquote> <i>I did not go easy to motherhood. I faced it as soldiers face their enemies, girded and
                        braced, sword up against the coming blows. Yet all my preparations were not enough.</i>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Other Greek myths play out in the background - that of the Minotaur, and of Icarus, as well as many
                    others - but it is Circe's personal tale that hits the hardest. I just hope we don't have to wait
                    another seven years for Miller to write another novel like this.
                </p>

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
