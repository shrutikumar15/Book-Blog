                <h3>The Wrath and the Dawn</h3>
                <blockquote> <i>“Make sure they never forget. You are the Calipha of Khorasan, and you have the ear of a
                        king.” She bent forward and lowered her voice. “And, most important, you are a fearsome thing to
                        behold in your own right.”</i> </blockquote>

                <p>My original plan was to finish this book tonight and then write up a review tomorrow, but after that
                    ending, I just can't stop thinking about it and I need to get my thoughts down right now. In short:
                    I enjoyed this book very much. Way more than I expected to, to tell the truth. And I guess you
                    should know that, though there are many elements of fantasy and action, it is primarily a romance.
                    And yet...</p>

                <p>It completely melted my cold, unromantic heart.

                </p>

                <p>Where should I start? The Wrath and the Dawn was a deliciously angsty, sexy romance inspired by A
                    Thousand and One Nights. If you know me, you know how often I complain about romances - either the
                    guy's a jerk, the girl's annoying or they fall into some crazy instalove that just leaves me bored.
                    Well, I finally found a romance where I just loved the characters, totally obsessed over what would
                    happen, and finished the final page with a pounding heart.
                </p>

                <p>My god, what has this book done to me?

                </p>

                <p>This story is about Khalid, the Caliph of Khorasan, who takes a new bride each night only to have her
                    executed at sunrise. When Shahrzad's friend becomes the Caliph's victim, Shazi volunteers herself
                    with a plan to outwit the evil ruler and exact revenge. In a similar way to Keturah and Lord Death,
                    Shazi extends her date with death by telling Khalid a story and promising only to reveal what
                    happens next if he should let her live another day.</p>



                <p>As it turns out, of course, nothing is as it first seems and Khalid is hiding many secrets. The
                    relationship between the two develops from seething hatred (on Shazi's part) to reluctant companions
                    to something much more. I've been craving a romance that feels genuine in its development and
                    actually has me wondering how things will turn out (and, god help me, the jury's still out on that
                    last point). The dialogue between them is addictive and feels natural... and don't you just love
                    stories within stories?

                </p>

                <p>Though I said this book is primarily a romance, there are many other things that need mentioning.
                    There are some beautiful descriptions of the palace, for one thing, and a wonderful cast of
                    secondary characters that all feel important to the story and not just throwaway. Jalal is charming
                    and hilarious, Despina is a source of much-needed female friendship for Shazi, Yasmine is intriguing
                    and bitchy (but kinda in a good way) and Tariq inspired a mixture of love/hate feelings in me.

                </p>

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
