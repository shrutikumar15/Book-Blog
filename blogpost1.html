                <h3>Normal People</h3>
                <blockquote> <i>No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the
                        attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything,
                        allow them to depend on you, why not. </i> </blockquote>

                <p>This is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, I think I liked it. And I say "liked it" in the
                    sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not
                    quite, and it is a profoundly lonely and depressing love story.</p>

                <p>I didn't begin by liking it. Normal People follows two characters - Marianne and Connell -
                    through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of
                    uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle
                    into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind of John Green
                    for adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.</p>

                <p>Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship
                    between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed,
                    marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet, I could not stop caring about them.
                    Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the
                    perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound
                    about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can
                    never forget.</p>

                <p>The story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne
                    is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas
                    Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell's mum works as a cleaner for Marianne's
                    family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends
                    will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social
                    status cause much conflict.

                <p>In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling
                    increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a
                    social world filled with social expectations. There's a bit of a When Harry Met Sally vibe,
                    except that this book is more soul-destroying.</p>
                <blockquote><i>Nothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to
                        be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise
                        of social acceptance.</i></blockquote>

                <p>There's clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that
                    grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by
                    other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might
                    give up who they love the most because they can't deal with how it makes them look to others.
                </p>

                <p>The pair's inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the
                    verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a
                    good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much.</p>

                <p>I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hated Normal People, but I didnâ€™t. I
                    actually kinda loved it. It's a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed
                    between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they
                    don't - in each other.</p>

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
