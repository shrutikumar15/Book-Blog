                <h3>Variant</h3>


                <p>I plunged into this thrilling novel with absolutely no expectations. I barely even knew the synopsis,
                    and I hadn't read any reviews or heard any hype. Luckily, I was immensely impressed with the
                    mastermind plot filled with conspiracies, jaw-dropping plot twists, and intense escape plans.</p>

                <p>The story is told by the suspicious teen Benson, who adamantly refuses to believe that Maxfield
                    Academy is simply a unique learning environment. Maybe it's the ever present security cameras
                    watching his every move, or the extreme punishments dolled out to those who break the rules. Either
                    way, Benson immediately realizes that he must escape from the educational prison. Benson's confident
                    defiance and willingness to defend what he believes in makes him an admirable protagonist.


                </p>

                <p>Inside Maxfield, there are three "gangs." In order to survive, each student must belong to one of
                    these very different groups. One of my favorite aspects of Variant was the well-defined identity
                    that each gang formed. The Society obediently enforces the school rules and hands out punishments.
                    The vicious Havoc group stakes their territory with violence. Those who do not belong to either of
                    these extreme groups belong to the V's, or Variants. As the story progresses, each gang's beliefs
                    become all the more obvious.


                </p>

                <p>The pages of Variant hold a gripping mystery. Who is behind the cruel academy, and why are they
                    imprisoning dozens of students? I was constantly trying to predict the school's next move, as well
                    as Benson's, but I was always way off base. I was SHOCKED by some of the revelations in this
                    fast-paced thriller. The ending left me hanging and desperate for a sequel!


                </p>

                <p>Overall, I am so thankful that I decided to give Variant a shot. The surprisingly original story had
                    me gasping and turning pages rapidly to figure out the next clue. I strongly recommend that everyone
                    check this one out!</p>

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
