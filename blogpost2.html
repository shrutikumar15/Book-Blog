                <h3>All the light we cannot see</h3>
                <blockquote> <i>So how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a
                        world full of light </i> </blockquote>

                <p>I'm going to be honest - love for this book didn't hit me straight away. In fact, my first attempt to
                    read it last year ended with me putting it aside and going to find something easier, lighter and
                    less descriptive to read. I know - meh, what a quitter.</p>

                <p>But this book is built on beautiful imagery. Both in the literal sense - the physical world of 1940s
                    Paris/Germany - and the metaphorical. It's woven with scientific and philosophical references to
                    light, to seeing and not seeing, and the differences between the two. It's a beautiful work of
                    genius, but it does get a little dense at times; the prose bloated by details.</p>

                <p>However, when we get into the meat of this WWII novel, it's also the harrowing story of a childhood
                    torn apart by war. It's about Parisian Marie-Laure who has been blind since she was six years old,
                    and a German orphan called Werner who finds himself at the centre of the Hitler Youth. Both of their
                    stories are told with sensitivity and sympathy, each one forced down a path by their personal
                    circumstances and by that destructive monster - war.</p>

                <p>I think this is the kind of book you will never appreciate if you stop too soon - I learned that
                    lesson. From the first to last page, there is a running theme of interconnectedness, of invisible
                    lines running parallel to one another and sometimes, just sometimes, crossing in the strangest of
                    ways. These two lives we are introduced to seem to be worlds apart, and yet they come together and
                    influence one another. It was this, more than the predictably awful tale of war, that made me feel
                    quite emotional.</p>

                <p>In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling
                    increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a
                    social world filled with social expectations. There's a bit of a When Harry Met Sally vibe,
                    except that this book is more soul-destroying.</p>

                <p>All the Light We Cannot See is haunting. That's how I would describe it. From the chillingly
                    beautiful prose, to the realization of what the title actually means: that underneath the surface of
                    history, there is light - and stories - that have not been seen; that have gone untold.
                    Scientifically, we only see a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; historically, we only
                    see a small portion of the story.

                    <p>I tend to have strong emotional reactions to books. This can sometimes come across as abrasive,
                        but I am honestly a laid back, open-minded person (I just get all gushy and passionate with
                        books). I will always be respectful of readers who have different opinions and I don't think our
                        different tastes mean we can't be book-loving friends. If you feel the same, come say hi! </p>
